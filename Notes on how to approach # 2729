Start with a first point work on that then tackle the second one and see how far we can go ...

#2729 will become more interesting in the 2nd two parts
Where you can use a tool other than xcode to build your project.

Heres the link to Samuel's example of extraction and re-writing : 
https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/2637



Start with :

Which pods are in the xcode project ?
What is in the pods xcode project ?
What does it consist of if we do a pod install ( what do we need to generate this) ?
what does it need to be generated (list of pods that are part of the podfile + more information) ?
How (already inside CP somewhere)can we get this info from the rest of CP ?
What does the xcode plug in need to make it work ?

Key:

  What does it need?
  What will it produce?




As long as one pt can be worked on 

The Bullet pts. need to be implemented from top to bottom 

Filled in bp's are headlines
unfilled ones are 
concrete steps

resolver class
download class

we need to decouple them


how else could they communicate

with a manifest file 

without manifest file the resolver wouldn't really work.

define what manifest file would look like

the resolver determeins wether there even is a graph to see if they are compatible.

Plugins you could have multiple ones that perform the same funcionality
have more dynamic loading.

Gems are more specific

the plugin is also a gem that is specific to cocoa pods.

We need to extract the resolver out cocoa pods core into its own gem.

Tricky part: 
once its no longer inside CP how does it communicates with -

that's where the manifest comes in 
Creating components that can communicate with one another.

Once you change it the main CP wouldn't work anymore.
Goal to have multiple implementations.

How does the resolver communicate with the rest of CocoaPods ? 

We used to have a downlodader that didn't Cache.
